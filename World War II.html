    <h1>World War II</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries—including all the great powers—eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries.</p>
    <h2>Which side?</h2>
    <p>World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45. The principal belligerents were the Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—and the Allies—France, Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and, to a lesser extent, China. </p>

    <h2>Major Events</h2>
    <h3>The Beginning of the War - German invasion of Poland</h3>
    <p>When Hitler invaded Poland on the 1st of September 1939, war in Europe began. German troops invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, triggering World War II. In response to German aggression, Great Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany. Nazi Germany possessed overwhelming military superiority over Poland. The assault on Poland demonstrated Germany’s ability to combine air power and armor in a new kind of mobile warfare.</p>

    <h3>German 'Blitzkrieg' - The Battle of Britain</h3>
    <p>The Battle of Britain was a military campaign of the Second World War, in which the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against large-scale attacks by Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe.

The British officially recognise the battle's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940, which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941.</p>
