        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>The Modern Olympic Games, also known as the Olympics</strong>, <em>are leading international sporting events</em> featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, alternating between the Summer and Winter Games every two years in the four year period.</p>
        <h2>The Summer Olympics</h2>
        <h3>Summary</h3> <p><strong>The Summer Olympic Games</strong> or the Games of the Olympiad, first held in 1896 in Athens, Greece, is a major international multi-sport event held once every four years. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) organises the Games and oversees the host city's preparations. In each Olympic event, gold medals are awarded for first place, silver medals are awarded for second place, and bronze medals are awarded for third place; this tradition began in 1904. The Olympics have increased in scope from a 42 competition event programme with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations in 1896, to 306 events with 11,238 competitors (6,179 men, 5,059 women) from 206 nations in 2016.</p>
        <h3>History</h3> 
        <p><strong>The Modern Summer Olympic Games</strong> were founded in 1894 when Pierre de Coubertin sought to <em>promote international understanding through sporting competition</em>. He based his Olympics on the Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games, which had been contested in Much Wenlock since 1850.[4] The first edition of de Coubertin's games, held in Athens in 1896, attracted just 245 competitors, of whom more than 200 were Greek, and only 14 countries were represented. Nevertheless, no international events of this magnitude had been organised before. 
        The 1896 Summer Olympics, officially known as <em>the Games of the Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event</em> which was celebrated in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. It was the first Olympic Games held in the Modern era. About 100,000 people attended for the opening of the games. The athletes came from 14 nations, with most coming from Greece. Although Greece had the most athletes, the U.S. finished with the most champions. Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, consequently Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organised by Pierre de Coubertin, a French pedagogue and historian, in Paris, on 23 June 1894. The IOC was also established during this congress.</p>

        <h2>The Winter Olympics</h2> 
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p><strong>The Winter Olympic Games</strong> is a <em>major international multi-sport event</em> held once every four years for sports practiced on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympic Games, the 1924 Winter Olympics, were held in Chamonix, France. The modern Olympic Games were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.</p>
        <h3>History</h3> <p>Although some skating events were included in the 1908 and 1920 Games, it was not until 1924 that the Winter Games were accepted as a celebration comparable to the Summer Games and given the official blessing of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3> <p><strong>The Paralympic Games or Paralympics</strong> are a periodic series of international multi-sport events involving athletes with a range of disabilities, including impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency, leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment. There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, are held almost immediately following the respective Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).</p>
        <h3>History</h3> <p>In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann organised a sports competition involving World War II veterans with a spinal cord-related injury in Stoke Mandeville, England. Four years later, competitors from Holland joined the Games, and the international movement, now known as the Paralympic Movement, was born. Olympic-style games for athletes with a disability were organised for the first time in Rome in 1960. In Toronto in 1976, other disability groups were added and the idea of merging together different disability groups for international sports competitions was born. In the same year, the first Paralympic Winter Games took place in Sweden.</p>
