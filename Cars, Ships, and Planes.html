    <h2>Cars</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>A car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Cars run mostly on roads, they can carry one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into commercial use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is when the modern car was invented when German inventor Karl Benz made his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. One of the first cars avaliable to the public was the 1908 Ford Model T.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The car was first made in Germany and France in the late 1800s, though Americans quickly took over the car industry in the second half of the twentieth century. Henry Ford innovated mass-production techniques that became standard, and Ford, General Motors and Chrysler emerged as the “Big Three” auto companies by the 1920s. Once vital to the expansion of American urban centers, the industry had become a shared global enterprise with the rise of Japan as the leading automaker by 1980.</p>

    <h3>Famous Cars</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic</li>
        <p>The Type 57 Atlantic is the kind of car that can never be copied, reproduced or emulated without utterly ruining the memory. The sheet metal alone will send you home drooling, as if you’d seen the most sensuous woman in the world. With curves galore and an elongated hood, the Atlantic looked like nothing else on the road in its day and still stands apart over the generations. Like a vintage era Batmobile, it’s both Powerful and elegant. It now auctions north of 30 million dollars and is essentially the world’s most expensive car.</p>

        <li>1936 Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray Coupe</li>
        <p>Also known as the C2, this version of the Corvette turned things around for Chevy. Redesigned completely, it sported a now much sought after split window, Corvette-only reverse flip-up headlights, improved handling and performance and a gorgeous silhouette made the C2 a standout amongst American sports cars. Produced for 20 years, the Sting Ray Coupe is as American as it gets. Part elegance and all sinew, the wide and sleek C2 will forever be associated with brilliant American design.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/1963-Chevrolet-Corvette-Sting-Ray-Coupe.jpg", width=400>
        <li>AC Shelby Cobra 427</li>
        <p>The stuff of legend, this is. Carroll Shelby approached Ford MoCo in order to shoehorn its monster 520 bhp, 427 V-8 into the AC Cobra, a British sports car. The result was magic and threw down with the previously victorious Chevy Corvettes in auto racing. It was a triumph of huge proportions. Shelby’s beast did the quarter-mile in 13.2 seconds and handled like it was on rails. And though the production of these monsters ended in 1967, the automotive world would never be the same.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ac-shelby-cobra.jpg", width=400>
        <li>Acura NSX</li>
        <p>When the NSX was introduced to the public in 1990, it was one of the most technologically advanced supercars ever made. The first production vehicle to use an all-aluminum monocoque chassis, it was made even more rigid after consultation by the famous F1 driver, Ayrton Senna. The lightness of the engine, frame and body aided in top-notch performance numbers which did not go unrecognized. The NSX garnered major automotive awards and redefined the supercar for the 21st century. When we see this rarity on the street today, it still makes us want one. So it’s sometimes referred it as the ‘poor man’s Ferrari’, it stands on its own as one of the greats.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Acura-NSX.jpg", width=400>
        <li>Mazda Miata</li>
        <p>Make no mistake. This tiny roadster single-handedly revived the type for the world. Mazda produced this car back when everything about tiny convertibles pointed to the crusher. Light and rear-wheel drive, the precision and the “snikt” sound of the shifter along with nimble and taut dynamics were driving heaven. Even now, after four generations, the Miata (MX-5) still brings the kind of pure driving pleasure that no amount of automotive technology can replace.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Mazda-Miata.jpg", width=400>
        <li>1967 Pontiac GTO</li>
        <p>Otherwise known as the “Judge”, the GTO was actually named after Ferrari’s 250 GTO (Gran Turismo Omologato), despite the dissimilarities. The split grille design and the monster 335 hp, 441 lb ft V8 engine, along with the optional Hurst shifter made it a true American classic and the sales figures proved its popularity. Today, a pristine model is worth a pretty penny. The modern version of it was basically a rebadged Holden Monaro from GM Australia, and though it was quick, it didn’t even come close to the presence of the original.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1967-Pontiac-GTO.jpg", width=400>
        <li>Rolls Royce Phantom</li>
        <p>The original British luxury car that started its run in 1925, the Rolls-Royce Phantom moniker and heritage spread over seven model generations. Owned by the likes of John Lennon and the Sultan of Brunei (what doesn’t he own?), the Phantom exuded class and wealth. Driving in it can be equated with sitting in an executive boardroom on wheels. Though it may have suffered from a bit of bloatedness in its fifth and sixth generations, the seventh and current iteration proves to be the right combination of power, performance and sophistication. Like it for its power and size. Love it for its ever-upright logo’d wheel hubs and its door retractable umbrella holders. Who needs Grey Poupon?</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Rolls-Royce-Phantom.jpg", width=400>
        <li>McLaren F1</li>
        <p>In 1998, engineer Gordon Murray set the world on fire by setting a new production car top speed record of 231 mph in the F1. In a few words, it was supercar domination. The McLaren F1 was an exercise in a no-holds-barred approach to automotive supremacy utilizing ultralight materials, a production first monocoque carbon fiber chassis, superb aerodynamics and a naturally aspirated BMW V12 with 618 horsepower. Uniquely for a production car, the center positioned driver’s seat echoed F1 design. But the car also stood out as an everyday supercar with its driveability and quality build. All other supercars are still measured against this one and its value and stature in the automotive world continue to rise.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/McLaren-F1.jpg", width=400>
        <li>Volkswagen Beetle</li>
        <p>An automotive hippie magnet, the Beetle could just be the most recognized car in the world. Built in colossal numbers for a world market, the Beetle was unsafe, underpowered and just plain unimpressive, except that it looked like nothing the world had ever seen. It was the car that made people happy just by looking at it. Don’t even get us started on the New Beetle. We think the 3rd try will be “the cleaner” and make us forget the tragically flawed but ever so successful designs of the first two.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Volkswagen-Beetle.jpg", width=400>
        <li>Porsche 356 Speedster</li>
        <p>Brought into existence by Ferdinand Porsche himself, the 356 is considered Porsche’s first production vehicle. A direct relation to the VW Beetle (say it isn’t so), the 356 was built it both coupe and Speedster forms from the 1940s through 1965 It wasn’t a speed machine, with only a flat-4 engine, but the design was both simple and classic. In various racing iterations, it made itself additionally famous in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Mille Miglia and still brings upwards of $300,000 at auction. Most importantly, it gave birth to the Porsche 911. Talk about good genes.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Porsche-356-Speedster.jpg", width=400>
        <li>lamborghini Miura</li>
        <p>The opposite of the sharp and angry Countach, the Miura was all sex-appeal and smooth lines. Widely regarded as one of the most beautiful automotive designs of all time, the Miura was built chassis and engine first and then covered in a svelte Bertone design. The monster mid-engine V12 and the two-seater setup essentially created the impetus behind the modern supercar. Only 764 were built between 1966 and 1972. It was recently duplicated in modern concept form in 2006, but the original stands as the true supercar classic. Gotta love the eyelash headlights.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Lamborghini-Miura.jpg", width=400>
        <li>Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4</li>
        <p>The new and Thousands of hours of research and development went into this pinnacle of supercardom. Released in 2005, the 8-liter W16, quad turbo, 1001 horsepower engine launched the original to a top speed of 253 mph, setting a new record for a roadgoing production car. If you mash the throttle to the maximum speed, a full tank of gas will be drained in 13 minutes. Crikey. Subsequent nutified versions were even more powerful–the Super Sport topping out at 268 mph, to be specific. Regardless of the version, the Volkswagen Group that brought this car to the world, did right by it and gave us unparalleled refinement in a sports car along with unsurpassed performance. It is over the top, over-priced and utterly desirable.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Bugatti-Veyron-EB-16.4.jpg", width=400>
        <li>Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione</li>
        <p>We consider the 8C Competizione a modern icon that will stand the test of time, carrying over the 8C name for the 1930’s version and the Competizione designation from the Alfa 1948 6C Competizione. Propelled by a big Ferrari 4.7 liter V8 generating 444 horsepower, the 8C Competizione has a carbon fiber body, double wishbone suspension and a six-speed sequential manual gearbox. Performance is a quick 4 second sprint to 60 and a top speed of 181 mph. What makes this car a modern icon is not so much the solid performance numbers but the jaw dropping design, with nary a straight hard edge to be found. With a classic Alfa grille and sensuous lines throughout, it’s art imitating car at the highest level. Speed, beauty, exclusivity (only 500 were made) and historic motoring genes are what make the 8C Competizione supremely desirable.</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/alfa-romeo-competizione-8C.jpg", width=400>
        <li>Ferrari Enzo</li>
        <p>No ultimate Ferrari list would be complete without the revolutionary Enzo, built from 2002-2004. Named after the founder of the marque, the Enzo brought true Formula One technology to the masses (the 399 people who constitute the limited ownership, that is) via a carbon fiber body, carbon ceramic brakes, hyper-quick F1 transmission and a 6.0 liter V12 engine. It could hit 60 in just over 3 seconds and top out at 220 mph. Sure, more recent Ferraris can outperform this track machine, but the Enzo bled red exclusivity and power never seen before in a vehicle from the Cavallino Rampante. It’s even more insane brother, the FXX, was reserved for the track only and came with its own technical team. We want.</p>

    <h2>Ships</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>A ship is a water vehicle that travels on the seas and the oceans, carrying goods or passengers, also serving for the military and research. Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and tradition.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The first ships were made by Ancient Egyptians in 4000 BC. By 1200 BC, the Greeks started to make larger ships, about 30m long. In the 8th century, the Vikings made longships, which could carry up to 100 people. In the 1500s to the 1800s, sailing ships dominated the world. Ships started getting bigger and bigger. In the 19th century, steam ships were invented. Steam ships ran using engines, unlike the past oars or sails. These ships could go faster and they were bigger too. After WW2, diesel engines became common in ships. Cargo ships became much bigger.</p>
    <h3>Famous Ships</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The USS Missouri</li>
        <p>The USS Missouri, also known as the “Mighty ‘Mo”, is a 45,000 ton battleship that was decommissioned after the war, she was reactivated and sent to fight during the Korean War, and again in 1984, when she became part of Ronald Reagan’s 600-ship fleet plan.</p>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Battleship_USS_Missouri.jpg/640px-Battleship_USS_Missouri.jpg", width=400>
        <li>HMS Victory</li>
        <p>No single ship serves as a better symbol for the power that was the Royal Navy during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century than does Lord Nelson’s venerable and, indeed, almost legendary, flagship, the HMS Victory. One of the largest wooden warships ever built, the ship not only saw considerable action in the last decades of the eighteenth century fighting both the French and Spanish fleets, but she became the stuff of legends at the pivotal battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where Nelson was to be mortally wounded but not before besting the combined French and Spanish fleet and effectively saving England from a sea-borne invasion.</p>

        <li>The Bismarck</li>
        <p>Perhaps no ship struck as much fear into the heart of the British Navy in the spring of 1941 than the massive German dreadnought Bismarck which, at 823 feet and with a top speed of 30 knots, was the largest and fastest warship then afloat. Breaking out of her Baltic haven in late May, 1941 intend on decimating the ragged and besieged British merchant fleet keeping the British Isles afloat, the ship became the subject of the largest naval hunt in Royal Navy history and one that was to cost the British dearly.</p>

        <li>The USS Arizona</li>
        <p>Few ships illicit the sort of emotion among American veterans as does the name Arizona. A World War One era battle wagon with an undistinguished career, her active life in World War Two lasted a mere fifteen minutes before she was sunk by a well-aimed Japanese bomb that ignited her forward magazine and tore her in two during the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941. The “unlucky shot”—a one-in-million hole in one—killed 1,177 men out of her crew of 1,400—including her captain and an admiral—and left her a blazing wreck that was to burn for days.</p>

        <li>the RMS Titanic</li>
        <p>Easily the most famous ship in history, this luxury liner was designed to showcase mankind’s technological brilliance but instead only illustrated his hubris. The largest and fastest passenger ship of its time, the British White Star liner left England on April 10, 1912 on its maiden voyage to New York, only to strike an iceberg five days later and sink.</p>

        <li>The Mayflower</li>
        <p>The Mayflower was an English ship that transported the first English Puritans, known today as the Pilgrims, from Plymouth, England to the New World in 1620. There were 102 passengers, and the crew is estimated to have been about 30, but the exact number is unknown.</p>

        <li>Oasis of the Seas</li>
        <p>Oasis of the Seas is an Oasis-class cruise ship owned and operated by Royal Caribbean International. As of 2020, she is the third largest passenger ship in the world behind her sisters, Harmony of the Seas, and Symphony of the Seas.</p>

    <h2>Planes</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>An airplane or aeroplane is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement. Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The history of flying started way back in 400 A.D with the Chinese. They invented the kite, which got scientists thinking about wind currents and how they worked. In 1485, a famous painter (Leonardo Da Vinci) drew pictures of flying machines. However, it wasn’t until much later when two brothers were successful in making the first flyable airplane. The date that made history was December 17th, 1903 when the dream of Orville Wright and his brother, Wilbur came true. Orville took to the sky in his first ever motor-powered aircraft. The airplane sputtered to life and flew 120 feet (36 meters) in only 12 seconds. People were astonished that their dream of flying was now being made possible.</p>
    <h3>Famous Planes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Wright Flyer</li>
        <p>The Wright Flyer was the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft. It was designed and built by the Wright brothers. They flew it four times on December 17, 1903, near Kill Devil Hills, about four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.</p>
