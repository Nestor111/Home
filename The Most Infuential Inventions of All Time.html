        <h1>The 14 Most Infuential Inventions of All Time</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>An invention is a unique or new device, method, composition or process. An invention may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result. An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a breakthrough. An inventor may be taking a big step toward success or failure.</p>

        <h2>The Wheel</h2>
        <p>A wheel is a circular block of a hard and durable material with an axle. The wheel is used to transport people or objects by using the axle to spin the wheel around and around, therefore moving the person or the object which is on top of the wheel. </p>

        <h3>History</h3> 
        <p>The Elamites created the first wheel in about 4500 BC. Early wheels were simple wooden discs cut from a tree. In 2000 BC, the spoked wheel was invented, meaning the vehicle could travel faster. The Sintashas created the first spoked wheel. Soon after the spoked wheel was invented, horse drawn chariots were invented in the Caucasus region. Cletic chariots had the first iron wheels. In China, wheel tracks came to use. The Nubians put the wheel to good use in 400 BC by using it to spin pottery and for using it as water wheels. The spoked wheel continued to be used without any major modifications until the 1870s, when wire spoked wheels and pneumatic tires came to be. This type of wheel continues to be used today. </p>
        <h3>Effect of the wheel on our lives</h3>
        <p>The wheel was an extremely important technological development, almost as significant as the ability to control and use fire. Civilizations that made use of the wheel had a greater ability to produce food, manufacture goods, and transport goods and people than those that did not.</p>
        <h2>The Telephone</h2>
        <p>The Telephone is a telecommunications device that allows two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly. A telephone converts sound, usually and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user.</p>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Alt_Telefon.jpg", width=300>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Credit for the invention of the telepohone is frequently disputed. Several inventors pioneered experimental work on voice transmission over a wire and improved on each other's ideas. Charles Bourseul, Antonio Meucci, Johann Philipp Reis, Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray have all been credited with the invention of the telephone.</p>
        <p>However, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be awarded a patent for the electric telephone by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in March 1876.</p>
        <h3>Effect of the telephone on our lives</h3>
        <p>The telephone allowed people to interact with other types of individuals, and this ability intrigued the American public. The telephone made it possible for contact to take place with people who normally can not because of being apart by large distances. People want to communicate quickly with others, and the telephone makes this happen.</p>
        <h2>Peniccilin</h2>
        <p>Peniccilin is a group fo anitbiotics and they were the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphlococci and streptococci. They are widely used to day, though many types of bacteria have developed resistance. </p>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Penicillin_core.svg/800px-Penicillin_core.svg.png", width=300>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Starting in the late 19th century there had been many accounts by scientists and physicians on the antibacterial properties of the different types of moulds including the mould penicillium but they were unable to discern what process was causing the effect. The effects of penicillium mould were finally isolated in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming, in work that seems to have been independent of those earlier observations.</p>
        <h3>Effect of penicillin on our lives</h3>
        <p>Penicillin prevents the bacteria from synthesizing peptidoglycan, a molecule in the cell wall that provides the wall with the strength it needs to survive in the human body. The drug greatly weakens the cell wall and causes bacteria to die, allowing a person to recover from a bacterial infection.</p>
        <h2>The Computer</h2>
        <p>A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The first computer was invented in Charles Burbage in the 19th century. He designed the Analytical Engine and it was this that computers of today are based on. In 1937 the first electronic digital computer was built by Dr. John V. Atanasoff and Clifford Berry. It was called the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC).In 1951 the first computer for commercial use was introduced to the public; the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC 1). In 1953 the International Business Machine (IBM) 650 and 700 series computers made their mark in the computer world. During this generation of computers over 100 computer programming languages were developed, computers had memory and operating systems. Storage media such as tape and disk were in use also were printers for output. In1980 Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-Dos) was born and in 1981 IBM introduced the personal computer (PC) for home and office use. Three years later Apple gave us the Macintosh computer with its icon driven interface and the 90s gave us Windows operating system.</p>

        <h2>The Internet</h2>
        <p>The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.</p>
        <img src = "https://miro.medium.com/max/1008/1*VtkcYG4e0aKRcXEQUBsAAw.jpeg", width=500>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The Internet was developed in the United States by the "United States Advanced Research Projects Agency" (DARPA). The Internet was first connected in October of 1969 and was called ARPANET. The World Wide Web was created at CERN in Switzerland in 1990 by a British (UK) scientist named Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
        <h3>Effect of the internet on our lives</h3>
        <p>The Internet has turned our existence upside down. It has revolutionized communications, to the extent that it is now our preferred medium of everyday communication. In almost everything we do, we use the Internet. Ordering a pizza, buying a television, sharing a moment with a friend, sending a picture over instant messaging. Before the Internet, if you wanted to keep up with the news, you had to walk down to the newsstand when it opened in the morning and buy a local edition reporting what had happened the previous day. But today a click or two is enough to read your local paper and any news source from anywhere in the world, updated up to the minute.</p>
        <h2>The Compass</h2>
        <p>A compass is an instrument used for navigation and orientation that shows direction relative to the geographic cardinal directions (or points). Usually, a diagram called a compass rose shows the directions north, south, east, and west on the compass face as abbreviated initials.</p>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Kompas_Sofia.JPG/1200px-Kompas_Sofia.JPG", width=400>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The Han people of ancient China made the first compasses out of lodestone. The compass was later used for navigation during the Song Dynasty of the 11th century. Later compasses were made of iron needles, magnetized by striking them with a lodestone. Dry compasses began to appear around 1300 in Medieval Europe and the Islamic world. This was supplanted in the early 20th century by the liquid-filled magnetic compass.</p>
        <h3>Effects of the compass on our lives</h3>
        <p>The magnetic compass was an important advance in navigation because it allowed mariners to determine their direction even if clouds obscured their usual astronomical cues such as the North Star. It uses a magnetic needle that can turn freely so that it always points to the north pole of the Earth's magnetic field.</p>
        <h2>Paper</h2>
        <p>Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing, printing, packaging, cleaning, decorating, and a number of industrial and construction processes.</p>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Coloured%2C_textured_craft_card.jpg", width=400>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The oldest known archaeological fragments of the immediate precursor to modern paper date to the 2nd century BCE in China. The pulp paper-making process is ascribed to Cai Lun, a 2nd-century CE Han court eunuch. In the 13th century, the knowledge and uses of paper spread from China through the Middle East to medieval Europe, where the first water powered paper mills were built. Because paper was introduced to the West through the city of Baghdad, it was first called bagdatikos. In the 19th century, industrialization greatly reduced the cost of manufacturing paper. In 1844, the Canadian inventor Charles Fenerty and the German F. G. Keller independently developed processes for pulping wood fibres.</p>
        <h2>The Printing Press</h2>
        <p>A printing press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a print medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. It marked a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper or other medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer of ink, and accelerated the process. Typically used for texts, the invention and global spread of the printing press was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.</p>
        <img src = "https://www.prepressure.com/images/Gutenberg-press-replica.jpg", width=400>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The first type of printing was in China in 220 AD. This type, woodblock printing, was a technique for printing text, image or patterns. By the ninth century AD, printing had taken off, creating the first printed book in 868. By the tenth century AD, more than 400000 works were printed. In 1450, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the first printing press in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type based on a matrix and hand mould, adaptations to the screw-press, the use of an oil-based ink, and the creation of a softer an dmore absorbent paper.</p>
        <h3>Effects of the printing press on our lives</h3>
        <p>The invention of the printing press had a huge impact on the past and continues to impact our lives today. Printing allowed ideas to curiculate quickly and cheaply. Oringinally, the printing press was used mostly for books, pamphets, and newspapers. Now, we use printing for almost everything.</p>
        <h2>Optical Lenses</h2>
        <p>A lens is a transmissive optical device that focuses or disperses a light beam by means of refraction. A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or molded to a desired shape.</p>
        <img src = "https://sc02.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1_hzoFrGYBuNjy0Fo763iBFXaM/optical-telescope-lenses-achromatic-lens.png", width=500>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>It is generally accepted that the origin of the lens can be traced back to the ancient Roman philosopher, Seneca, who described, “letters could be magnified by a ball of crystal” about 2000 years ago. In 424 BC, the first mention of a lens was made in a play. A proper lens was put into use n the 13th century. Concave and Convex lanses in the 16th century.</p>
        <h3>Effects of the Optical Lens on our lives</h3>
        <p>There will be no life without lens for humans. All day we see through eyes lens. Most of artificial sensors used by humans are lens based like security cameras. All modern cars have light based sensors using camera lens. All mammals around us use eye lenses. Most of the creatures use eyes lenses. </p>
        <h2>Electricity</h2>
        <p>Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. In early days, electricity was considered as being unrelated to magnetism. </p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Benjamin Franklin had one of the greatest scientific minds of his time. He was interested in many areas of science, made many discoveries, and invented many thing. In the 1700s, he began to be interested in electricity. Up until that time, scientists had mainly known about and experimented with static electricity. Benjamin Franklin took things a big step ahead. He came up with the idea that electricity had positive and negative elements and that electricity flowed between these elements. He also believed that lightning was a form of this flowing electricity. In 1752, Franklin conducted his famous kite experiment. In order to show that lightning was electricity, he flew a kite during a thunderstorm. He tied a metal key to the kite string to conduct the electricity.</p>
        <h3>Effects of electricity on our lives</h3>
        <p>Hospitals, air traffic control systems, street lights, modern sewage systems, most forms of communication, and the U.S. financial services industry are all dependent upon electricity. A major attack on or failure of the nation's power grids would shut down the country.</p>
        <h2>The Light Bulb</h2>
        <p>An electric light is a device that produces visible light from electric current. It is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities.</p>
        <img src = "https://media.rs-online.com/t_large/R7897918-01.jpg", width=200>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The electric light, one of the everyday conveniences that most affects our lives, was not “invented” in the traditional sense in 1879 by Thomas Alva Edison, although he could be said to have created the first commercially practical incandescent light. He was neither the first nor the only person trying to invent an incandescent light bulb. In fact, some historians claim there were over 20 inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison’s version.</p>
        <h3>Effects of electricity on our lives</h3>
        <p>The light bulb had a tremendous impact on our lives. With the light bulb, people could have a well-lit environment regardless of whether it was daytime or nighttime. It made it easier for people to read. It also made it easier for people to perform work-related tasks and to study.</p>
        <h2>The  Engine</h2>
        <p>An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy. Heat engines, like the internal combustion engine, burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to do work. </p>
        <img src = "https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/flexslider_full/public/slideshow_image/1-ferrari-355-engine.jpg?itok=i8nNU-4j", width=700>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>In 1872, American George Brayton invented the first commercial liquid-fueled internal combustion engine. In 1876, Nikolaus Otto, working with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, patented the compressed charge, four-stroke cycle engine. In 1879, Karl Benz patented a reliable two-stroke gas engine.</p>
        <h3>Effects of the engine on our lvies</h3>
        <p>The engine impacts our lives by making cars, planes and ships possible. What if we had no cars? There would be no travellign around the world and no getting to places quickly. Our life would be really boring.</p>
        <h2>The Automobile</h2>
        <p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.</p>
        <img src = "https://i.insider.com/5d0bd4b7e3ecba5d97628a02?width=1100&format=jpeg&auto=webp", width=500>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The first working steam-powered vehicle was designed — and quite possibly built — by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle. n 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use. Karl Benz invented the modern car.</p>
        <h3>Effects of the car on our lives</h3>
        <p>The car had many effects on our lvies. Cars:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dramatically changed the economy</li>
            <li>Enabled People to travel and relocate more readily</li>
            <li>Also meant death and injury</li>
            <li>Impacted the environment</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Plane</h2>
        <p>A plane is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research.</p>
        <img src = "https://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/airplane-flying-above-clouds_shutterstock_553131187-1068x601.jpg", width=600>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The history of flying started way back in 400 A.D with the Chinese. They invented the kite, which got scientists thinking about wind currents and how they worked. In 1485, a famous painter (Leonardo Da Vinci) drew pictures of flying machines. However, it wasn’t until much later when two brothers were successful in making the first flyable airplane. The date that made history was December 17th, 1903 when the dream of Orville Wright and his brother, Wilbur came true. Orville took to the sky in his first ever motor-powered aircraft. The airplane sputtered to life and flew 120 feet (36 meters) in only 12 seconds. People were astonished that their dream of flying was now being made possible.</p>
        <h3>Effects of the plane on our lives</h3>
        <p>In the past, global cultures rarely crossed paths. Only the explorer or adventurer would be able to meet and mingle with isolated communities across continents. Shipping was instrumental in transporting goods and people around the globe, and yet, the average citizen could rarely take advantage of it. They were busy working and trying to survive. Airplanes changed all that. Now you can sample tantalizing delicacies from anywhere in the world as well as introduce yourself to peoples in remote locations anywhere there is a landing strip.</p>
