        <li><strong>The Sydney Harbour Bridge</strong></li>
        <font size="3"</font>
        <p> 
            <strong>The Sydney Harbour Bridge</strong> is one of Sydney's two most famous <em>landmarks</em>, the other being the Opera House.
            Completed in 1932, the construction of the bridge - known locally as "The coathanger" - was an economic feat as well as an engineering triumph. Prior to the bridge being built, the only links between the city centre in the south and the residential north were by ferry or by a 20 kilometre road route that involved five bridge crossings.
            The Sydney Harbour Bridge took eight years to build, including the railway line. The bridge was manufactured in sections on a site that is now occupied by Luna Park fun fair. </p>
