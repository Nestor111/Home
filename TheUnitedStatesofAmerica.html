    <h1>The United States of America</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country
        consisting of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At
        9.8 million km2, it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area. Most of the country is
        located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million,
        the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world. The capital city of the United States is Washington
        D.C., and the most populous city is New York City.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Native Americans lived in the Americas for thousands of years. English people in 1510 went to the place now
        called Jamestown, Virginia. Other European settlers went to the colonies, mostly from England and later Great
        Britain. France, Spain, and the Netherlands also colonized North America. In 1775, a war between the thirteen
        colonies and Britain began when the colonists were upset over paying taxation to their government in the UK, but
        were not being given any chance to vote in the UK/British elections, to contribute to how that money was spent.
        On July 4, 1776, Founding Fathers wrote the United States Declaration of Independence. They won the
        Revolutionary War and started a new country. They signed the constitution in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in
        1791. General George Washington, who had led the war, became its first president. During the 19th century, the
        United States gained much more land in the West and began to become industrialized. In 1861, several states in
        the South attempted to leave the United States to start a new country called the Confederate States of America.
        This caused the American Civil War. After the war, Immigration resumed. Some Americans became very rich in this
        Gilded Age, and the country developed one of the largest economies in the world. In the early 20th century, the
        United States became a world power, fighting in World War I and World War II. Between the wars, there was an
        economic boom called the Roaring Twenties, when many people became richer, and a bust, called the Great
        Depression, when most were poorer. The Great Depression ended with World War II. The United States and the
        Soviet Union entered the Cold War. During this time, African-Americans, Chicanos, and women sought more rights.
        In the 1970s and 1980s, the United States started to make fewer things in factories. The country then went
        through the worst recession it had since the Great Depression. In the late 1980s, the Cold War ended, helping
        the United States out of recession. The Middle East became more important in American foreign policy, especially
        after the September 11 attacks in 2001.</p>

        <h2>Demographics</h2>
    <h3>Population</h3>
    <p>The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the country's population to be 328,239,523 as of July 1, 2019, and to be adding
        one person (net gain) every 13 seconds, or about 6,646 people per day. The U.S. population almost quadrupled
        during the 20th century, from 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000. The third most populous nation in the
        world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large
        population increases are projected. In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children; by the 1900s this number
        had decreased to 3.56. Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.76
        children per woman in 2017.</p>

    <h3>Language</h3>
    <p>American English is the de facto national language of the United States. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in 32 states.</p>
    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p>In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said religion played a "very important role in their lives", a far higher figure than that of any other Western nation. In a 2009 Gallup poll, 42% of Americans said they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi. According to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults in the United States identified themselves as Christians; Protestants accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholics, at 20.8%, formed the largest single denomination.[318] In 2014, 5.9% of the U.S. adult population claimed a non-Christian religion. These include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Hinduism (0.7%), and Buddhism (0.7%). The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion—up from 8.2% in 1990. There are also Unitarian Universalist, Scientologist, Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Zoroastrian, Confucian, Satanist, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Afro-American, traditional African, Wiccan, Gnostic, humanist and deist communities.</p>

    <h2>Economy</h2>
    <h3>Science and Technology</h3>
    <p>The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system called mass production.</p>
    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. These homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion. Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed. Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea. Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.</p>
    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport; the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.</p>
